# PPoGA v2: Predictive Plan-on-Graph with Action

A revolutionary knowledge graph question answering system that combines the proven reliability of Plan-on-Graph (PoG) with advanced predictive capabilities inspired by PreAct and dynamic replanning from PLAN-AND-ACT.

## 🎯 Overview

PPoGA v2 represents a complete reimagining of the PPoGA system, built on a solid foundation of the original PoG codebase while incorporating:

- **✅ Proven SPARQL Engine**: Direct integration with PoG's battle-tested Freebase query system
- **🔮 Predictive Reasoning**: PreAct-inspired outcome prediction before action execution
- **🧠 Enhanced Memory**: Three-layer memory architecture (Strategic, Execution, Knowledge)
- **🔄 Dynamic Replanning**: PLAN-AND-ACT inspired strategic plan modification
- **🎯 Self-Correction**: Two-level correction mechanism for tactical and strategic failures

### 🧹 Code Organization & Cleanup

**✅ Active Codebase (Clean & Maintained)**

- `src/ppoga_project/PoG/`: Original PoG research SPARQL engine (160 lines, optimized)
- `src/ppoga_project/ppoga_v2/`: PPoGA v2 extensions with predictive capabilities
- `src/ppoga_project/main_ppoga_v2.py`: Main execution system (403 lines, tested)

**📦 Legacy Codebase (Archived)**

- `legacy/`: All duplicate, experimental, and outdated implementations
- Removed circular imports and code duplication
- Preserved development history for reference

### Three-Layer Memory Architecture

1. **Strategic Layer**: Plans, rationale, and strategic decisions
2. **Execution Layer**: Prediction-Action-Observation-Thought cycles
3. **Knowledge Layer**: Discovered entities, relations, and reasoning paths

### Six-Step Workflow

1. **Strategic Plan Decomposition**: Break complex questions into executable steps
2. **Outcome Prediction**: Predict results before taking action (PreAct)
3. **SPARQL Execution**: Use PoG's proven query engine for actual KG exploration
4. **Observation & Thought**: Compare predictions with reality and analyze
5. **Memory Update**: Update all three memory layers with new information
6. **Evaluation & Self-Correction**: Decide next action (proceed/correct/replan/finish)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Freebase Setup**: Deploy local Freebase following [PoG instructions](https://github.com/liyichen-cly/PoG)
2. **Python Environment**: Python 3.11+ with required dependencies
3. **OpenAI API Key**: For LLM-powered planning and reasoning

### Installation

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <your-repo>
cd ppoga-project

# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Setup environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your OpenAI API key and Freebase endpoint
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Single question
poetry run python src/ppoga_project/main_ppoga_v2.py \
    --question "Who directed The Godfather?" \
    --max_iterations 8

# With custom settings
poetry run python src/ppoga_project/main_ppoga_v2.py \
    --question "What is the capital of France?" \
    --model gpt-4 \
    --max_iterations 5 \
    --verbose
```

### Environment Configuration

```bash
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
SPARQL_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8890/sparql

# Optional
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
MAX_ITERATIONS=10
MAX_DEPTH=4
VERBOSE=true
```

## 📊 Key Features

### 🔮 Predictive Reasoning (PreAct Integration)

- Predicts outcomes before executing KG queries
- Compares predictions with actual results
- Uses prediction accuracy to improve future planning

### 🧠 Enhanced Memory System

```python
# Strategic Layer
memory.strategy = {
    "overall_plan": [...],      # Strategic steps
    "plan_rationale": "...",    # Why this plan
    "replan_count": 0          # Adaptation tracking
}

# Execution Layer
memory.execution = {
    "cycles": {...},           # Prediction-Action-Observation-Thought
    "current_prediction": {}, # What we expect
    "current_observation": "" # What actually happened
}

# Knowledge Layer
memory.knowledge = {
    "discovered_entities": {}, # Entity mappings
    "exploration_graph": {},   # KG structure discovered
    "reasoning_chains": []     # Logical reasoning paths
}
```

### 🔄 Dynamic Replanning (PLAN-AND-ACT Integration)

- **Level 1 (Path Correction)**: Retry same plan with different approach
- **Level 2 (Strategic Replanning)**: Abandon current plan, create new strategy

### ⚡ Proven SPARQL Integration

- Direct use of PoG's `freebase_func.py` for KG queries
- Inherited reliability and performance optimizations
- Seamless entity resolution and relation discovery

## 📈 Performance Benefits

Compared to previous PPoGA implementations:

- **✅ Real KG Queries**: No more mock executors - actual SPARQL execution
- **🎯 Strategic Planning**: Coherent multi-step reasoning instead of ad-hoc exploration
- **🧠 Memory Persistence**: Information retention across planning cycles
- **🔮 Predictive Accuracy**: Learn from prediction vs reality comparisons
- **🔄 Adaptive Planning**: Dynamic strategy modification based on results

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Custom LLM Settings

```python
config = PPoGAConfig(
    model="gpt-4",
    temperature_exploration=0.1,  # More focused exploration
    temperature_reasoning=0.3,    # Balanced reasoning
    max_length=8192              # Longer responses
)
```

### SPARQL Endpoint Configuration

```python
config = PPoGAConfig(
    sparql_endpoint="http://your-freebase:8890/sparql",
    remove_unnecessary_rel=True  # Filter noise relations
)
```

### Execution Control

```python
config = PPoGAConfig(
    max_iterations=15,            # Longer exploration
    max_depth=6,                 # Deeper KG traversal
    prediction_confidence_threshold=0.8  # Higher accuracy bar
)
```

## 📚 Research Background

PPoGA v2 synthesizes insights from three foundational papers:

1. **Plan-on-Graph (PoG)** - Self-correcting adaptive planning with backtracking
2. **PreAct** - Predictive reasoning through outcome prediction
3. **PLAN-AND-ACT** - Dynamic replanning with role separation (Planner/Executor)

This implementation provides the first working system that meaningfully combines all three methodologies with proven KG infrastructure.
